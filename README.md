# (Flash) MultimediaFlashAnimation (Oct 2016)
A first attempt to create an functioning animation using methods, tools and techniques.
I wanted to understand how animation woked and decided to use Adobe Flash Professional CS6 as a first attempt
Most of my knowledge was obtained from online youtube videos, while I understand my animations and visuals are crude,
I am still proud I was able to incorperate as many animation aspects, features, techniques and code as I did.
The final animations, .swf and .fla can be downloaded from Google Drive (https://drive.google.com/open?id=0By88_FEDnEXWTm1EZ3hxMVgyUXM)
